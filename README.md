# ThreeSixtyFlow.js

This plugin gives you the ability to quickly and easily create a 3D carousel slider for your web site *without* having to:

* Do the math for Javascript or CSS transforms yourself. (If you hate doing math yet want your gallery to appear like it's floating in space this plugin is for you.)
* Figure out how to position the slider buttons using CSS for up-down or right-left scrolling.  (Flexbox in the CSS solves all your positioning woes and you can switch these controls on or off using simple true/false statements -- use them only if you need them.)
* Crafting your own animation sequence to make the 3D carousel move on its own.
